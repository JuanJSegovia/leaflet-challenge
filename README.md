# Earthquake Data Visualization with Leaflet


### Project Overview
This project visualizes earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using the Leaflet library for interactive mapping. The primary objective is to create a dynamic and educational map that displays recent earthquake activity globally. The map allows users to explore earthquake events with information on location, magnitude, and depth, while providing visual cues based on earthquake intensity and depth.


### Features
Interactive Mapping: Earthquake events are plotted on an interactive map, allowing users to zoom and pan across regions.
Magnitude-Based Marker Scaling: Earthquake markers vary in size based on magnitude, making more severe earthquakes more visually prominent.
Depth-Based Color Coding: The depth of each earthquake is represented by a color gradient, helping users identify shallow vs. deep earthquakes at a glance.
Detailed Popups: Each marker includes a popup with detailed information about the earthquake, such as location, magnitude, depth, and occurrence date.
Legend: A legend on the map explains the color gradient for earthquake depth, enhancing user comprehension.


Fetch Earthquake Data: The map uses live data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed. Select the desired earthquake dataset to visualize.

Run the Project: Open index.html in a web browser to view the interactive map. (file:///Users/juansegovia/Desktop/Classwork%20Projects/leaflet-challenge/index.html)

### Usage
Viewing Earthquake Data: Open the map and explore recent earthquake events worldwide. Each marker provides popup information on location, magnitude, depth, and time.
Interpreting Colors and Sizes: Larger markers indicate higher magnitudes, while the color gradient represents depth, with darker shades indicating deeper earthquakes.
Legend and Styling: A legend is provided to clarify the color gradient representing earthquake depths. The project utilizes custom styles to enhance the readability and interpretability of the data.
